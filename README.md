Viral is a work-in-progress app for the GNOME desktop. It provides the ability to easily perform an anti-virus scan on files using `libclamav`.

It's built using the same codebase as the amazing [Raider](https://github.com/ADBeveridge/raider) by Alan Beveridge, an app for GNOME that in terms of structure and design is almost exactly what I envision for Viral (except instead of shredding files we're scanning them). This is my first foray into desktop application development and the GNOME ecosystem, so I'm very grateful that I can start small and dip my toes in the water using a really great project to work off of.
